# password-generator

## Description

This project is an example of a random password generator, I was motivated to create this specific project to utilize what I have learned thus far in specific regard to JavaScript and adding functionality to a webpage, for example event listeners, if statements, creating and calling variables, and much more. These uses could solve the problem of a webpage not being the most ineractive, by adding prompts and information confirmation it really gives the user/visiter a first person, hands on experience with something as simple as creating a password. Creating this project also taught me and really made sense of how an array of objects can be created into a variable and called upon later in the JS script.
